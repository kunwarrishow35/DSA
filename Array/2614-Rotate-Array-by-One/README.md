Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 69.6%Submissions: 391K+Points: 1Average Time: 20m

Given an array arr, rotate the array by one position in clockwise direction.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: If we rotate arr by one position in clockwise 5 come to the front and remaining those are shifted to the end.
Input: arr[] = [9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3]
Output: [3, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1]
Explanation: After rotating clock-wise 3 comes in first position.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

Expected Complexities

Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
